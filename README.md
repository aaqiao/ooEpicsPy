# ooEpicsPy
`ooEpicsPy` is a Python version of `ooEpics` (https://github.com/aaqiao/ooEpics) aiming at developing soft IOCs. Base classes are provided to skeleton EPICS soft IOCs, mainly or middle-layer application servers. `ooEpicsPy` provides the following features:
- EPICS database can be created by creating objects of `LocalPV`s in the user code.
- Basic Channel Access functions (e.g. `caget`, `caput`, `camonitor`, w/o callbacks â€¦) are wrapped by the `RemotePV` class based on the `PyEpics` module. 
- Provides base classes to implement finite state machines.
- Provides an active `Application` class to execute user command driven jobs.
- Provides an example soft IOC code in the folder `example`.
